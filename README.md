# Javascript Random Password Generator 

## Week 3 Challenge
 For this challenge, we use JavaScript to program the functional behavior of the website. The goal is to generate a random password after gathering user inputs through a series of prompts that ask for password preferences. Specific criteria for the generated password may include having a length of 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special character types.
